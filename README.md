# Stock101 AWS  Project

This repository documents my freelance Cloud & DevOps project for [Stock101.org](https://www.stock101.org), where I architected, deployed, and managed AWS infrastructure with a focus on scalability, performance, and cost optimization.

## ðŸš€ Project Overview
- **EC2 & VPC**: Provisioned and configured secure VPCs with subnets, NAT gateways, and security groups. Deployed scalable EC2 instances with auto scaling and monitoring.
- **Elastic Beanstalk**: Hosted the main application using Python 3.11 platform on Beanstalk. Managed deployments, health checks, and automated scaling.
- **Lambda**: Built event-driven serverless functions for backend automation. Integrated with S3 triggers and EventBridge Scheduler.
- **S3**: Architected storage buckets for structured/unstructured data, static website hosting, and applied lifecycle policies for cost savings.
- **Route 53 & Domains**: Configured hosted zones and registered domains (stock101.org), enabling DNS failover routing.
- **CloudFront (CDN)**: Integrated to deliver applications globally with HTTPS and low latency.
- **EventBridge Scheduler**: Automated recurring tasks such as cleanup and maintenance using fixed-rate schedules.
- **CloudWatch**: Implemented monitoring dashboards, alarms, and logs for proactive troubleshooting.
- **Cost Optimization**: Applied strategies including autoscaling rules, EC2 right-sizing, and S3 Intelligent-Tiering.
